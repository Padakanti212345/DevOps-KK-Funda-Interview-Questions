Encourage your  partons every DevOps Engineer must know

When a deployment fails:

1) Don’t call a developer.
2) Don’t fix the configuration.
3) Don’t dive into the logs.
4) Don’t panic.

The first thing you do is Roll back.

Why?

Because business continuity comes first. Everything else comes second.

The business is on hold when the system goes down,
and that's not an option.

Every second of downtime matters.
For some businesses, 10 minutes of downtime can cost thousands—or even a million.

E-commerce sites lose sales.
Banks face trust issues.
Streaming platforms lose viewers.

So roll back immediately, stabilize the system and then investigate.

Remember: A smooth recovery is more valuable than a rushed fix.

Here are similar key points that every DevOps Engineer should know to handle critical situations effectively:


---

When a Server is Under High Load:

1. Don’t restart the server immediately.


2. Don’t kill processes randomly.


3. Don’t increase resources (CPU/RAM) as a quick fix.


4. Don’t ignore the root cause.



What to do first:
Scale horizontally if possible (add more servers) or redirect traffic temporarily to reduce the load. Then, analyze the system for bottlenecks like inefficient queries, memory leaks, or high disk I/O.


---

When Monitoring Alerts Trigger Repeatedly:

1. Don’t silence the alerts without investigation.


2. Don’t disable the monitoring tool.


3. Don’t blame the monitoring system.


4. Don’t wait for it to stop on its own.



What to do first:
Identify if the alert threshold is too sensitive or if there’s an actual issue. Prioritize immediate fixes for production-impacting problems, but review your alerting logic afterward to prevent future noise.

When CI/CD Pipelines Fail:

1. Don’t push code manually as a workaround.


2. Don’t ignore the pipeline error messages.


3. Don’t disable test suites for faster builds.


4. Don’t bypass the pipeline checks.



What to do first:
Analyze why the pipeline failed—was it a flaky test, incorrect configuration, or dependency issue? Fix the pipeline to ensure future deployments are seamless and reliable.

When a Database Connection Fails:

1. Don’t restart the database blindly.


2. Don’t bypass authentication mechanisms.


3. Don’t increase connection limits immediately.


4. Don’t alter database configurations reckles

What to do first:
Check if the issue is due to network problems, high traffic, or connection leaks from the application side. Apply
